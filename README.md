# TeamStreamBOT

The TeamStream BOT allows users to seach a custom repository for videos via keywords as well as the results from Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API.

The project uses the Microsoft BOT Framework, Azure Web App Services, Azure Function Apps and Azure Document DB.

Future updates will contain more robust computer vision (Faces, Celebrity etc.), Azure Search as well as Azure Media Services.
